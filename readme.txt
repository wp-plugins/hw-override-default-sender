== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it override all e-mails? =

No. It will only intervene if it detects that the e-mail about to be sent has the WordPress default sender information. It means that existing plugins, filters or in other way specified e-mail sender information will be untouched and still work as expected.

= What about Reply-Path? =

It will always override the Reply-Path header if not prohibited by your server configuration. It will do so by setting the Reply-Path e-mail address to the same address as the From value.
